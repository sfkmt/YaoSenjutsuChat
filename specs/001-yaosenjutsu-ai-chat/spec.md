## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a non-expert user seeking accessible astrology insights for personal growth, I want to have a natural conversation with an AI chatbot about my concerns (such as career or love life), provide my birth information when prompted, and receive personalized, easy-to-understand coaching advice based on astrology calculations, so that I can gain meaningful insights without needing to understand complex astrological terminology.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user accessing the chat interface for the first time, **When** they ask a question about their future (e.g., "Will 2025 be good for my career?"), **Then** the system prompts them for necessary birth information (date of birth and location) and provides personalized astrology-based advice in Japanese
2. **Given** a user who has already provided their birth information in a previous message, **When** they ask a follow-up question (e.g., "What about my love life?"), **Then** the system uses the stored context to provide relevant advice without asking for birth information again
3. **Given** a user starting a conversation, **When** they have not yet consented to data usage, **Then** the system displays a privacy consent modal before collecting any personal information
4. **Given** a returning user with a session ID, **When** they continue their conversation, **Then** the system loads their previous conversation history and context

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user provides invalid birth date format?
- How does system handle when user refuses to provide birth location?
- What happens when astrology calculation service is unavailable?
- How does system respond to non-astrology related questions?
- What happens when user wants to change previously provided birth information?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a conversational chat interface where users can type questions in natural language
- **FR-002**: System MUST extract and validate user's date of birth from conversation
- **FR-003**: System MUST extract and validate user's birth location from conversation
- **FR-004**: System MUST calculate astrological charts based on user's birth information
- **FR-005**: System MUST convert technical astrological data into non-technical, coaching-style responses in Japanese
- **FR-006**: System MUST request user consent before collecting personal data
- **FR-007**: System MUST persist conversation history across sessions using a unique thread identifier
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide responses within [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: acceptable response time not specified - 2 seconds? 5 seconds?]
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle follow-up questions using stored conversation context
- **FR-010**: System MUST display a privacy policy that users can access
- **FR-011**: System MUST support both mobile and desktop viewing experiences
- **FR-012**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified - 30 days? 1 year? indefinitely?]
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: expected number of concurrent users not specified - 10? 100? 1000?]
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide error messages when unable to generate astrological insights
- **FR-015**: Users MUST be able to start new conversation threads

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
